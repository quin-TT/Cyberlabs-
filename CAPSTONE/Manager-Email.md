## Email From Manager

| Your manager has emailed you asking for recommendations as they are setting up the security policies and protocols for the company.They?re hoping you can give them: a set of recommendations on what they need to consider or be aware of, to make sure they are covering their bases. They will use the recommendations from the whole team to create a robust security policy for your organization.
As usual, your manager is in a hurry so you need to email them back as soon as possible.Context:Premium House Lights Inc. is an Ontario-based boutique company that sells and install luxury lighting for upscale buildings and homes. The company operates an e-commerce website and a brick-and-mortar store, serving a loyal customer base.
The company website relies on the server to communicate back and forth to complete transactions and store customer data. Premium House Lights values customer trust and needs to protect customer data, including payment information and personal details. |  |

## Email To Manager

To: [Manager?s Name]Cc: [Relevant Team Members]Bcc: [Additional Stakeholders]Subject: RE: Recommendations for Security Policies



Hi [Manager?s Name],

I?ve provided recommendations based on my analysis of our company?s needs, risks, and objectives.The following is a structure to guide our current task of developing  security policies and protocols.



Please highlight points of interest and further research points as you read.



### 1. Risk Tolerance

1. Low Risk Tolerance: Breaches involving customer data (payment details, PII).
1. Moderate Risk Tolerance: Operational delays if necessary to implement security upgrades.


### 2. Key Vulnerabilities and Threats

- Vulnerabilities:
1. Potential gaps in server communication security.
1. Lack of network segmentation increases lateral movement risks.
1. Phishing and social engineering attacks targeting employees.
- Threats:
1. Malware and ransomware attacks targeting customer and financial data.
1. DDoS attacks potentially disrupting e-commerce operations.
1. Insider threats due to inadequate training or accidental errors.






### 3. Recommended Risk Management Frameworks and Processes

- Framework:
1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): https://csf.tools/framework/csf-v2-0/ (A structured approach to identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from threats)
This tool provided offers a thorough set of controls to address organizational needs. To effectively use this guide, review the available controls and prioritize them for assignment to assets. Document the selected controls in a security plan  to ensure they are implemented, assessed, authorized, monitored, and reviewed as part of the CSF framework lifecycle

Note: If your team is unfamiliar with using CSF, I can provide a quick overview

1. Why NIST CSF?
1. Comprehensive yet adaptable to different organizational needs and incorporates critical security controls  for additional depth 
1. Compatible with compliance requirements through a rich library of NIST RMF controls and integrates with other frameworks like ISO27001.
1. Process:
1. Identify critical assets and their associated risks.
1. Develop a plan to prioritize, implement, monitor, and evaluate controls.


### 4. Key Recommendations for the Security Policy

- Data Security:
1. Encrypt all data in transit with TLS/SSL and at rest with AES-256 encryption.
1. Classify data into categories (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted) and apply controls based on sensitivity.
1. Adjust each data classification into the matrix according to risk tolerance because each category of data requires different levels of security in the way that it is stored, accessed, shared across people, infrastructure or services and how it is backed-up.
- Access Control:
1. Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all accounts.
1. Apply :least privilege principles to minimize unauthorized access risks.
- Network Security:
1. Implement a DMZ for the web server to separate public-facing services from internal systems.
1. Segment the network into VLANs for production, employees, and sensitive systems.


### 5. Monitoring and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

- Monitoring Recommendations:
1. Deploy a Security information and event management (SIEM) system for centralized log analysis and real-time threat detection.
1. Monitor IoCs such as:
1. Unusual login attempts.
1. Unexpected spikes in traffic or data transfers.
1. Unauthorized file modifications.


6. Processes to Enhance Security Posture

- Vulnerability Assessments:
1. Conduct regular scans of public-facing systems, including the web server through vulnerability monitoring and scanning, using tools like OpenVAS.
1. Schedule penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
- Employee Training:
1. Provide quarterly training and education  to help employees protect insider threats ,  recognize phishing attacks and human error ,  and handle sensitive data securely.
1. Create an incident response plan for anticipated events. In the case of this organization, phishing, ransomware, denial of service, and attacks on web server are some significant incidents to consider.


### Timeline (Tentative)

Use the NIST RMF steps as a timeline guideline for implementing these recommendations 

| Phase  | Key activities | Duration |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Prepare  | Review objectives, assign roles, and introduce NIST CSF to the team. | 3 days |
| Categorize | Classify assets and perform risk assessments | 4 days  |
| Select  | Select controls in Critical Security Controls and across the NIST CFS 2.0 | 5 days |
| Implement | Deploy controls for data, network, and organizational security | 20-40 days |
| Assess | Test and validate controls for effectiveness | 10-20 days |
| Authorize | Review implementations and authorize those which pass review | 3-5 days |
| Monitor | Ongoing monitoring and reviews to ensure compliance and effectiveness | Continuous |




The 75-day timeline is flexible depending on resources, and cybersecurity is an ongoing process. Implementing policies and controls is part of the CSF lifecycle. To start, use CSF visualizers  for team exploration of controls.

If you require further clarification, I?m happy to provide more details or assist in prioritizing the next steps.
