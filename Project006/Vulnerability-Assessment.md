1. Executive Summary


This vulnerability assessment report outlines the findings from scans conducted using Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) to evaluate and prioritize security risks across three systems: Windows 11 machine, Linux Server, and Localhost (Kali Linux).

The scans identified vulnerabilities, categorized by severity as follows:

- Windows 11: Medium vulnerabilities, including deprecated encryption protocols and unfiltered service enumeration.
- Linux Server: High-priority vulnerabilities, such as default credentials and expired TLS certificates.
- Localhost: Informational warnings, such as outdated scan engines and configuration issues, which do not represent direct threats but may impact the reliability of scans.
Key Findings

- Windows 11 machine: Risks include outdated encryption protocols and unnecessary service exposure on port 135.
- Linux Server: Risks include potential unauthorized access due to default credentials and compliance issues from expired certificates.
- Localhost: Highlighted self-check findings, such as the need to update the scan engine to ensure comprehensive detection.


Image above, two  have vulnerabilities of varying severity and localhost has informational warnings .Fixes for each vulnerability are found in the Risk Assessment section.To combat total security failure, It is recommended to follow the mitigations before continuing operations.

A system administrator is a role that can accomplish all of these mitigations.Further follow the recommendation section at the end of this document to learn about GVM as part of vulnerability monitoring.



Scan Results

Overview of Scans

| Scan name | Target | Data | Pdf Scanned |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Full and Fast Scan | Localhost | 11/25/2024 | localhost |
| Full and Fast Scan | Linux Server | 11/25/2024 | linux |
| Full and Fast Scan | Windows 11 Machine | 11/25/2024 | windows |










1. Methodology


1. Tools Used: Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) with the "Full and Fast" default  scan configuration.
1. Target Systems: OpenVas scans were performed on three different environments
1. Windows 11 machine: 10.0.2.6
1. Linux Server: 10.0.2.15
1. Localhost: 10.0.2.8
1. Scan Configuration:
1. Quality of Detection (QoD): 70%
1. Ports Scanned: Default (includes [list specific ports if applicable])
1. Type of Scan: External, non-privileged.
1. Steps Taken:
1. Added targets manually by IP addresses.
1. Conducted host discovery to verify reachability.
1. Applied default settings for vulnerability scans.
1. Exported scan results for further analysis.
It is good practice to scan the GVM host itself first before proceeding to other scans, to ensure tool security and reliability of scan coverage





Results exported in PDF format for analysis of the previous Scan Results section of this document. Findings were filtered based on severity (Critical, High, and Medium) and a Quality of Detection (QoD) threshold of 70% or higher. Informational findings from the Localhost scan were included to ensure the scanning environment's reliability.There are 7 actionable findings prioritized for mitigation. These included deprecated protocols, default credentials, and insecure cryptographic configurations. The Localhost scan findings highlighted outdated scan engines and ICMP timestamp replies, which were addressed to optimize scanning accuracy for the other systems. This methodology ensured actionable vulnerabilities were prioritized while maintaining the reliability of the scanning process.In practice, mitigations from this inherited warning should be acted on, and it is a primary reason to scan the GVM host first.





1. Findings


The vulnerability assessment scanned three systems: Windows Server, Linux Mate, and Localhost (Kali Linux). The results showed various issues related to outdated software, weak configurations, and insecure settings. Fixing these problems is essential to protect the organization from potential security threats.

The Windows Server scan revealed:

- Exposed Services (Port 135): Certain services can be accessed by attackers, making it easier for them to gather sensitive system details.
- Outdated Encryption (TLSv1.0/1.1): Older encryption methods are still in use, which are no longer secure and could allow attackers to access sensitive data.
- System Timing Information: System uptime and other timing details are visible(which attackers could use forr attacks)
The Linux scan identified:

- Default Passwords (Port 9200): Using default passwords makes it easy for attackers to break into the system.
- Expired Security Certificates: Old certificates mean data is not properly secured and could lead to compliance problems.
- Weak Encryption: The system uses weak encryption, making it easier for attackers to read confidential communications.
- System Timing Information: Like Windows, the system?s timing details are exposed.
The Localhost did not identify exploitable vulnerabilities with severity levels, it revealed areas where the scanning environment could be improved (e.g., updating the scan engine). These findings are not vulnerabilities in the organization?s systems but are important to ensure the tool itself works effectively

- Outdated Scanner: The scanner being used needs an update to ensure accurate and reliable results.
- Timing Information: Similar to the other systems, some timing details are exposed, which could help attackers plan attacks.
See each table in the Risk Assessment section (below) for provided mitigations.Each mitigation can be easily researched and followed by a system administrator.





1. Risk Assessment
The tables below summarize the vulnerabilities identified during the scans, including their CVSS scores (where applicable), affected components, descriptions, associated threats, and recommended mitigations. These findings highlight critical areas that require attention to reduce potential risks to the organization.

The vulnerabilities are primarily related to outdated configurations, insecure protocol implementations, and exposed timing information. Mitigations, as detailed in the tables, are straightforward and can be implemented by a system administrator with existing resources.

Additionally, the GVM reports provide valuable references, including detailed vulnerability descriptions and links to NVD CVEs (e.g., CVE-2021-1234). These references can be used for further research and to validate mitigation steps.

While GVM primarily uses CVSS 3.0 and 3.1 to classify vulnerabilities, informational findings such as the End-of-Life Scan Engine and ICMP timestamp disclosures, though not assigned CVSS scores, are significant for ensuring accurate and reliable scans. These findings should be addressed promptly to optimize the scanning environment and prevent potential exploitation.

If risk assessment requires compliance with CVSS 4.0 standards, consider supplementing this document with additional resources.

1. Recommendations


After addressing the vulnerabilities outlined in the Risk Assessment tables (e.g., updating outdated services, improving configurations, and mitigating informational risks), the organization should focus on optimizing its use of Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) to strengthen its security posture further. The following recommendations are:

1. Mitigation Priorities:
1. Ensure immediate updates to outdated components like the GVM scan engine to improve detection capabilities and reduce scanning inaccuracies.
1. Disable insecure configurations, such as ICMP and TCP timestamps, to minimize risks of timing attacks or information leakage.
1. Apply updates or restrict access to vulnerable services (e.g., DCE/RPC on 135/tcp) to prevent reconnaissance and unauthorized access.
1. Optimal Use of GVM:
1. Schedule scans strategically to align with the organization?s operations, as scans can be resource-intensive. Use targeted scans, such as CVE-specific scans, between scheduled full scans.
1. Perform discovery scans to identify all network assets comprehensively. Populate scan targets using network inventory tools when possible to ensure all critical systems are included.
1. Integration and Alerts:
1. Configure GVM alarms for critical findings, using e-mail notifications, Syslog, or HTTP connectors to ensure timely alerts for detected vulnerabilities.
1. Integrate GVM results into asset management systems to maintain an up-to-date view of vulnerability statuses for critical systems like Windows Server and Linux Mate.
1. Advanced Features:
1. Leverage features such as applying overrides for false positives, setting a minimum Quality of Detection (QoD), or enabling automatic report deletion to optimize scan management.
1. Customize OpenVAS scan configurations to balance resource usage and thoroughness, such as adjusting the number of concurrently executed NVTs (Network Vulnerability Tests).
1. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Export GVM scan data in CSV format and connect it to SIEM or SOAR tools for enhanced reporting and compliance tracking.
1. Use visualizations to analyze vulnerability trends and assess mitigation progress. Create scripts for automated analysis tailored to the organization?s specific needs.
1. Long-Term Goals:
1. Aim for a broader integration of GVM with asset management tools, network monitoring systems, and SIEM solutions. For example, consider free-tier options like Blumira SIEM for improved visibility into vulnerabilities and security events
Ultimately, security goals should be of integrating; asset management tools, networking monitoring tools, and vulnerability management tools into a security information and event management (SIEM) system, such as the free tier Blumira SIEM (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, n.d.), would be ideal improve its cybersecurity posture.The recommendations that optimize the use of GVM should only be undertaken after the organization has followed through on mitigating the existing vulnerabilities in its system.Following GVM?s official documentation and best practices is highly recommended to optimize its functionality for the organization?s unique needs(Greenbone Networks, 2022)
