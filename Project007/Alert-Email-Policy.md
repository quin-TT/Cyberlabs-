Purpose

The primary objective of this policy is to mitigate the risk of unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of sensitive organizational information through email alerts.



Scope

This policy applies to the management of email alerts, whether they are manually or automatically triggered, particularly during incident response procedures.

Email alerts can potentially expose sensitive information related to MSPEI, its employees, members, or agents acting on behalf of MSPEI. This policy ensures proper handling of such alerts to prevent breaches of confidentiality.



2. Policy

1. Handling External Email Alerts:
1. MSPEI staff must exercise extreme caution when sending email alerts to external networks, ensuring that no sensitive or confidential information is inadvertently disclosed.
1. Restrictions on Automatic Forwarding:
1. Email systems should not automatically forward messages to external destinations unless explicitly authorized by an MSPEI Executive.
1. Sensitive Information:
1. No sensitive information, as defined in the MSPEI Policy on the Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Personal Information (Medical Society of Prince Edward Island, 2022), should be sent via email unless the message is essential for MSPEI operations. Additionally, such emails must be encrypted according to the Acceptable Encryption Policy (yet to be developed).


3. Policy Compliance

1. Compliance Measurement:
1. The MSPEI CSIRT Executives are responsible for ensuring compliance with this policy. This will be done through various methods, including periodic audits, monitoring, feedback from staff, and both internal and external reviews.
1. Annual Review:
1. This policy should be reviewed on an annual basis to ensure it remains effective and up-to-date.


4. Exceptions
