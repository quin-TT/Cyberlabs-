1. Overview


Email communication is extensively used in most industries and is often the primary method of communication within an organization. However, misuse of email can lead to various legal, privacy, and security risks. It is essential for users to understand the proper use of electronic communications within the Medical Society of Prince Edward Island (MSPEI).



Purpose



The purpose of this policy is to ensure the proper use of MSPEI's email system and to inform users of the acceptable and unacceptable use of its email services.

This policy sets the minimum standards for email usage within the MSPEI network, ensuring that email communication is handled securely and ethically.



Scope



This policy applies to the use of any email sent from an MSPEI email address and covers all employees, contractors, and agents acting on behalf of MSPEI. It outlines the expected use of email within the MSPEI environment.
