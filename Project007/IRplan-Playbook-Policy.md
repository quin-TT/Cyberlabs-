IR Plan, Playbook and Policy 

Medical Society of Prince Edward Island







1. Introduction


The Medical Society of Prince Edward Island (MSPEI), established in 1855, is the second oldest medical society in Canada. As a division of the Canadian Medical Association, MSPEI is a small non-profit organization with approximately 400 members. While MSPEI may not have the resources to obtain full management support for a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) or a dedicated Incident Response (IR) Team, it is still essential to implement a set of procedures and guidelines in case of a cybersecurity incident.

This Incident Response Plan (IR Plan) is crucial for guiding MSPEI in responding to security incidents effectively, and it includes standard procedures, policies, and playbooks that align with best practices in cybersecurity.

A clear and practical example of why such a plan is necessary comes from an industry-related incident that occurred in the same Canadian province in 2023. In that incident, SkillsPEI, a division of the Department of Workforce, Advanced Learning and Population, experienced a data breach due to an employee mistakenly sending an email outside the government network. This breach involved the personally identifying information (PII) of over 5,600 individuals. Though the exact details were not fully disclosed, it was reported that phishing was the tactic used in the attack.

Such incidents highlight the vulnerability of organizations, and the importance of having a structured response plan in place to handle cybersecurity threats effectively.

Given these considerations, I strongly encourage the Medical Society of Prince Edward Island (MSPEI) to adopt this Incident Response Plan, along with a custom Phishing Playbook and three developed policies to enhance its preparedness for future incidents.

The Incident Response Plan has been developed with the understanding that MSPEI is likely to rely on its own personnel to form the Cyber Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). It is my hope that MSPEI will eventually develop its own CSIRT to be better equipped in responding to incidents and minimizing potential damage.
