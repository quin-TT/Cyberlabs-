Incident Response Plan Policy

The Medical Society of Prince Edward Island





1. Executive Summary
### 

Overview



An Incident Response Plan (IRP) provides the framework for MSPEI's Cyber Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to coordinate their efforts in terms of awareness, communication, and response during critical situations, such as when a security vulnerability is identified or exploited.

The IRP outlines authority structures, roles and responsibilities, escalation paths, and approval processes. It also includes an incident severity matrix, guidelines for incident handling, and engagement levels expected from various team members.

The plan is integral to ensuring that MSPEI can swiftly mitigate and remediate any incidents when they arise.



### Purpose

The objective of this policy is to establish the requirement for all MSPEI CSIRT-supported roles to develop and maintain an Incident Response Plan.

This ensures that the necessary information is available to effectively manage a security incident and that MSPEI CSIRT Executives have the right resources to formulate a timely response should an incident occur.



### Scope

This policy applies to any defined MSPEI CSIRT unit and the roles it supports within the Medical Society of Prince Edward Island (MSPEI).



### 2. Policy



MSPEI CSIRT Executives

The MSPEI CSIRT Executives are responsible for the creation, implementation, and management of the Incident Response Plan (IRP).

They are tasked with overseeing the development of the IRP and ensuring that it aligns with MSPEI's operational needs. Executives are expected to facilitate the deployment of the IRP across applicable services and work closely with the MSPEI CSIRT members to develop and maintain the plan.

Service Description

The IRP must clearly define the services that MSPEI will provide in response to security incidents. This includes an assessment of data flows, system architecture, and identifying critical touchpoints within the organization.

Contact Information

The IRP must include the contact details for dedicated team members who can be reached during non-business hours in case an incident occurs and escalation is necessary. These contacts must be available 24/7 if required based on the value of the services and their potential impact on MSPEI members.

The document should include all relevant phone numbers and email addresses for MSPEI CSIRT members who may need to be contacted.

Authority, Roles, and Expected Levels of Engagement

The IRP must define the authority and responsibility for the security of MSPEI and member information. This includes outlining the roles and expected levels of engagement for each role within the MSPEI CSIRT.

The plan should detail the primary roles, as well as secondary and tertiary backup roles to ensure smooth operation during an incident.

Approvals

The IRP must be authorized by the relevant authority as specified within the plan.

Identified Mitigations and Testing

The IRP should include a clearly defined process for identifying and testing mitigations before they are deployed. This should cover both short-term fixes and long-term remediation strategies.

In cases where these processes are not fully developed, MSPEI CSIRT members responsible for the IRP's creation and maintenance must continue to mature these elements to ensure that the mitigation strategies are tested and ready for deployment.

Mitigation and Remediation Timelines

The IRP must set out clear timelines for addressing identified vulnerabilities. These timelines should be based on the severity of the incident and its potential impact on MSPEI members, the organization, or any other affected parties.



### 3. Policy Compliance



Compliance Measurement

MSPEI CSIRT Executives must ensure that a written IRP is in place and available to relevant personnel, stored under version control, and accessible via a web portal. Regular audits and reviews should be conducted to ensure the policy remains up-to-date.

This policy will be reviewed annually to maintain its relevance and effectiveness.



### Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must receive prior approval from the MSPEI CSIRT Board, and a written record of the exception must be kept.



### Non-Compliance

The IRP is critical to ensuring MSPEI's operational integrity and the protection of sensitive data. In the event of a security incident, the swift execution of the IRP can significantly mitigate harm to MSPEI members and other affected stakeholders.

Failure to adhere to this policy may result in severe consequences, especially if an incident occurs and the IRP is not adequately applied. MSPEI CSIRT members and responsible parties may be held liable for negligence if the IRP is not implemented appropriately.
